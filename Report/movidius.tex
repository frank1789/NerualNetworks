\section{Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick}
\label{sec:movidius}
Today, low-power consumption is indispensable for unmanned vehicles and IoT 
(Internet of Things) devices.
In order to develop deep learning inference application at the edge, we can use 
Intel’s both energy efficient and low cost Movidius 
USB\footnote{Universal Serial Bus} stick, in figure \ref{fig:movidius}.
Movidius Neural Compute Stick (NCS) is produced by Intel and it can be run 
without any need of Intenet. 
This software development kit enables rapid prototyping, validation, and 
deployment of deep neural networks. 
Profiling, tuning, and compiling a DNN on a development computer with the tools 
are provided in the Intel Movidius Neural Compute SDK.
The Movidius NCS’ compute capability comes from Myriad 2 VPU\footnote{Vision Processing Unit}.
Intel Movidius VPUs drive the demanding workloads of  modern computer vision 
and AI applications at ultra-low power. 
By coupling highly parallel programmable compute with workload-specific hardware 
acceleration, and co-locating these components on a common intelligent memory 
fabric, Movidius achieves a unique balance of power efficiency and high performance. 
Movidius technology allows device makers to deploy deep neural network and 
computer vision applications in categories such as smart-phones, drones, 
intelligent cameras and augmented reality devices.
Running Deep Learning models efficiently on low capacity graph processors is very painful. 
Movidius allows us to optimize the operation of large models such as GoogLeNet.
with multi-use support.
It is an easy-to-use kit that allows you to design and implement applications 
such as classification and object recognition as physical products.
We can simply think of Movidius NCS as a GPU\footnote{Graphics Processing Unit} 
running on USB. 
However, training of the model is not performed on this unit, the trained model 
works optimally on the unit and is intended to be used in physical environments 
for testing purposes.

\subsection{Inside Intel Movidius}
\label{subsec:techspec}
Movidius provides the ultimate in low-power vision processing solutions, which 
include the Myriad 2 family of vision processing units (VPUs) plus a 
comprehensive Myriad Development Kit, a reference hardware EVM and 
optional Machine Vision Application Packages.
The Myriad 2 MA2x5x family of system-on-a-chip (SoC)\footnote{System on Chip} 
devices offers significant computation performance and image processing 
capability with a low-power footprint.
The Myriad 2 line up includes the following product configurations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item	MA2150: 1 Gbit DDR
	\item	MA2155: 1 Gbit DDR and secure boot 
	\item	MA2450: 4 Gbit DDR
	\item	MA2455: 4 Gbit DDR and secure boot
\end{itemize}

Myriad 2 VPUs offer TeraFLOPS (trillions of floating-point operations per 
second) of performance within a nominal 1 Watt power envelope. 
The Myriad 2 architecture, show in figure \ref{fig:architecture}, includes enough 
performance to support multiple cameras with flexible image signal processing 
pipelines for each camera, and software programmable vision processing with 
fixed- and floating-point data-types supported. 
A robust overall data-flow design ensures mitigation of processing bottlenecks.\\
Myriad 2 MA2x5x incorporates an innovative approach to combine image signal 
processing with vision processing. 
A set of imaging/vision hardware accelerators supports a world-class ISP pipeline 
without any round trips to memory; at the same time they are re-purposed to 
accelerate developers' vision processing algorithms in conjunction with a set of 
special purpose VLIW vision processor cores. 
All processing elements are tied together with a multi-ported memory that enables 
implementation of demanding applications with high efficiency.\cite{intel}\\
