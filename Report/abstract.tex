The intent of this project is the rapid development of a neural network for
image classification. 
After a brief theoretical presentation of the functioning of a neural network,
the reader is introduced to the world of deep neural networks and classification. 
Thanks to the use of framework like Keras is possible to develop refinement 
techniques starting from already known models.
There is discussion of the architecture of a USB commercial device, Intel 
Movidius neural compute stick, with low power consumption for neural network 
execution on SoC systems such as Raspberry.
Finally, there are the problems and limitations that occurred during the 
development and distribution of the software implemented.
