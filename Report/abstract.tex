The intent of this project is the rapid development of a neural network for
image classification. 
After a brief theoretical presentation of the functioning of a neural network,
one enters the world of deep neural networks and classification. Thanks to the 
use of frameworks like Keras this is possible by moving the first steps using 
refinement techniques starting from known models.
There is discussion of the architecture of a USB commercial device, Intel 
Movidius neural compute stick, with low power consumption for neural network 
execution on SoC systems such as Raspberry.
Finally, there are the problems and limitations that occurred during the 
development and distribution of the software implemented.
